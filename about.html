    <p>The future of work is in the online world. A world that is full of possibilities and offer limitless opportunities to get things done with much less hassle. Digital revolution has permeated almost all facets of life such that efficiency at work may be himdered by deficiency in digital literacy. Today, digital technology has revolutionized the way we work and relate â€“ individuals and businesses who lack the right digital skills are not just being left behind, they are also losing out a great deal. It therefore becomes imperative to learn and leverage on the new opportunities offered by digital technology. In other words, success in the today's world of work is determined, to a great extent, by one's ability to understand the use and effectively utilize the many digital tools that make work easier, simpler and more efficient...Digital Literacy is regarded as the ability to find, evaluate, utilize, share, and create content using information technologies and the Internet (Cornell University). In a similar fashion, digital education is the innovative use of digital tools and technologies during teaching and learning. It is otherwise referred to as Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) or e-Learning. Digital literacy affords educators the opportunity to design relevant, engaging learning experiences in their various subject areas and deliver lessons in a more efficient way. Digital education can either be taken fully online or together with the traditional form as a blended classroom. It is expected that 21st century learners would take a cue from its import and adjust their learning in the right direction.</p>
